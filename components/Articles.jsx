      "Presented at the New Voices in International Law conference on May 8th at the Trinity College Long Room Hub. In an era marked by accelerating technological advancement and an escalating climate emergency, this paper critically reconsiders the foundations and functions of international law. It argues that the existing legal architecture rooted in state-centric sovereignty and sectoral regimes struggles to effectively govern the transboundary, intergenerational, and technologically mediated challenges of our time. By adopting a multidimensional approach, this paper explores how international law can evolve to better integrate climate imperatives, digital transformations, and global accountability. Drawing on legal pluralism, systems thinking, and governance theory, it proposes pathways for reconfiguring legal norms, institutions, and responsibilities across state and non-state actors. Ultimately, the paper advocates for a shift towards a more inclusive, adaptive, and ecologically literate international legal order that reflects the interconnected realities of the 21st century.",

While centralised exchanges remain relevant in the crypto ecosystem, the future may be increasingly decentralised. What could have been an opportunity soon became a power vacuum rather than added services and customer operations towards Binance. Another round of scrutiny came from various regulators towards CEX(s). Instead of providing more services and Users, Binance, the largest CEX in the world, must now restrict its offering and re-adapt its suite to ensure compliance.",

This book has been developed as a collaborative effort by the Blockchain & Climate Institute's Legal Research Division. This volume offers the first book-length exploration of how carbon markets can be governed using DLT, offering conceptual and theoretical analysis, practical case studies, and a roadmap for implementation of a DLT-based architecture in major existing and emerging carbon markets. It surveys existing expertise on distributed ledger technology, provides progress updates from industry professionals, and shows how this technology could offer a cost-effective and sustainable solution to double-counting and other governance concerns identified as major challenges in the implementation of carbon markets.",
